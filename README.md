## Net price calculator prototype

- `net-price-calculator.html` uses the site's downloaded styles to render the graduate cost calculator in a layout that matches Lincoln University.
- `net-price-calculator.js` contains the calculator logic (tuition, program fees, books) with semester/year toggling.
- `net-price-calculator.css` adds light layout/styling on top of the site's CSS for the calculator section.
- The calculator is also embedded inside `Academics _ Lincoln University of Missouri.html` just below the page introduction, using the same assets.
- Adjustable values live in the inline `window.netPriceConfig` script in each HTML file (slider min/max/default/ticks, tuition rates, program fee rates, book cost per course).
- `prototype.html` holds the earlier standalone mockup if you need to reference the original design.
